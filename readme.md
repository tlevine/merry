Someone was named "Merry". That's weird. Was that previously more popular?

1. `query.js` is a mapreduce on Tom's SSDMF Mongo database.
2. `merry.json` is the output.
3. `csv.js` converts that to csv. It doesn't quite work.
4. `merry.csv` is the csv
5. `merry.r` converts that to some plots.
6. `merry.pdf` is the plots.
